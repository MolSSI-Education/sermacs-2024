    "\n",
    "<strong>Questions</strong>\n",
    "\n",

    "So far in this workshop, we have learned about using Python for fairly general applications. During the afternoon session, we will use Chemistry-specific libraries with the goal of performing a molecular docking calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we load an \"ideal\" structure for a small molecule ligand downloaded from the Protein Data Bank and then we manipulate it using a Python library called RDKit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken here is manual. We will pick atoms of interest visually, then morph atomic numbers in order to change a carbon atom into a nitrogen atom, and then add a methyl group by changing a hydrogen atom into a carbon atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "By loading our molecule from an ideal structure with 3D coordinates, we can ensure that we're already near a \"good structure\" that we can use for docking.\n",

    "| Library    | Description     |\n",
    "| :-----------: | :------------ |\n",
    "| rdkit | Cheminformatics Toolkit |\n",
    "| Chem | A subset of rdkit for molecule manipulation |\n",
    "| IPythonConsole | A subset of rdkit to control image quality |\n",
    "| Draw | A subset of rdkit for structure drawing |\n",
    "| AllChem | A subset of rdkit for optimizing 3D structures |\n",

    "## Molecular File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with molecules on a computer, molecules are often represented in a number of different file formats.\n",
    "As you may conclude from the rest of our notebooks, working with this \"zoo\" of file formats can sometimes be overwhelming.\n",
    "Depending on what you are trying to do, you may use a particular file format or a number of different file formats. \n",
    "Often, you will have to pick a file format based on the software you are using or the molecular information you want to save. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we will work with a ligand called `13U` that binds to the enzyme trypsin.\n",
    "You can see the structure for the ligand and protein [here](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2ZQ2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizing the Ligand\n",
    "We have downloaded the ideal structure for this molecule as an SDF (structural data file). \n",
    "An SDF typically includes the 3D coordinates of a molecule. \n",
    "Let's use a Python library called NGLView to take a look at the 3D structure of our ligand."
